# HotStop-Fan
Why cool things down when it's hot?This brilliantly impractical fan does the exact opposite-it turns off when the temperature rises.Using an Arduino,a DHT sensor and a relay.This setup ensures that the moment that you really need a breeze,it politely refuses to help.It really gives an USELESS PROJECT vibe.
