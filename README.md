#HotStop Fan üéØ


## Basic Details

### Project Description
Fan that turns off when the temperature rises.Using an Arduino,a DHT Sensor and a relay module.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In certain experimental or demonstration scenarios, there is a need for devices that operate under unconventional logic to test system behavior, demonstrate reverse control mechanisms, or explore unique automation ideas. Traditional fans turn on when temperatures rise; however, this project explores the opposite approach, where the fan intentionally turns off above a set temperature threshold.
### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Build an Arduino-controlled system that reads temperature from a DHT sensor and turns the fan OFF when the measured temperature rises above a set threshold. Includes wiring, Arduino sketch, a simple safety debounce, and a README-ready summary for GitHub.
